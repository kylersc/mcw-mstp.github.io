| Name | Email | Background |
|---|---|---|
| Stephen | smazurchuk@mcw.edu | I work mainly with fMRI datasets (imaging data) and have a strong background in Python and Matlab. <br>Also somewhat knowledgeable in some machine learning topics |
| Moujtaba | mkasmani@mcw.edu | My work is centered around using sequencing techniques such as bulk RNA-seq, scRNA-seq, and scTCR-seq to study the immune system. Most of my work is done in R, although I occasionally use some tools directly in the Linux terminal/command line. |
| Kyler | kscrawford@mcw.edu | I study the structural biology of chemokine signaling, and use protein modeling and visualization to guide biochemistry research. I'm not an expert but I give ABACUS tutorials on what I am learning. |
